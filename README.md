                    Description
 This Project is about creating the database about Railway Reservation 
System
The railway reservation system facilitates the passengers to enquire about 
the trains available on the basis of destination, booking and cancellation of 
tickets, enquire about the status of the booked ticket, etc. The aim of case 
study is to design and develop a database maintaining the records of 
different trains, train status, and users. The record of train includes its 
number, name, description, capacity, time, destination
Users can book their tickets for the train in which seats are available. For 
this, user has to provide the desired train number and the date for which 
ticket is to be booked. Before booking a ticket for a user, the validity of 
train number is checked. Once the train number and time are validated, it is 
checked whether the seat is available. If yes, the ticket is booked with 
confirm status and corresponding ticket ID is generated which is stored 
along with other details of the user. The ticket once booked can be 
cancelled at any time.
